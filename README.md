# Verified Origin Protocol (VOP)

VOP is a neutral system designed to verify the declared origin of digital content
in a world where visual authenticity can no longer be trusted.

VOP does not detect AI.
VOP does not judge truth.
VOP does not store files.

VOP only answers one question:

*Does this content have a verifiable origin?*

## Status
This repository contains the initial public specification and prototype
of the Verified Origin Protocol.

## Principles
- Origin over appearance
- Declaration over detection
- Verification over judgment

## License
Open specification. Experimental prototype.
